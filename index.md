I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the AI & Society program jointly organized by the School for the Future of Innovation in Society ([SFIS](https://sfis.asu.edu)) at Arizona State University (ASU) and the New York Academy of Sciences ([NYAS](https://nyas.org)). My broad research interest is in investigating the notion of trust in information and information technologies, and in studying how society and advanced AI could co-shape each other. My doctoral dissertation (at the [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu){:target="_blank"} at The University of Texas at Austin) was focused on how AI-based synthetic audiovisual media (such as deepfake videos) influence public trust in video and in visual journalism.
